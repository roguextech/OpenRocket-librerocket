    <title>Using the files in /db/</title>

    <h2>What is /db/?</h2>
    <p>/db/ refers to the folder in which all of the program's non-code and non-asset data is stored. This leaves the file <code>theme.json</code>, and the several material and motor files. This is also the place where any downloaded or user-created presets will be stored, unless the user preset path is changed in <code>/cfg/settings.json</code>.</p>
    <h2>Materials.json</h2>
    <p>This file stores all of the materials known to the program. It also stores the properties of those materials. In this file there are three sections:
        <ul>
            <li><code>struct</code>, which stores structural materials</li>
            <li><code>line</code>, which stores materials used in shock cords</li>
            <li><code>chute</code>, which stores parachute materials</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Struct</h3>
    <p>The entries in this section take the form:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <code>
            "material_name" : { <br>
            &emsp;  "density": density_in_kg/m3 <br>
            },
        </code>
    </blockquote>
